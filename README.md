# Vendor-Fleet-System
This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of a fleet of cabs and drivers within a hierarchical vendor structure. It aims to digitize and simplify the onboarding and monitoring processes involved in fleet operations, especially in organizations where multiple vendors and subvendors are involved.

At its core, the system facilitates robust user authentication, driver and vehicle onboarding, and role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access the data and features appropriate to their role (admin, parent vendor, subvendor, etc.). Vendors are structured in a parent-child hierarchy, allowing parent vendors to manage their own assets as well as monitor and oversee the activities of their associated subvendors. This hierarchical model promotes scalability and clear accountability across different organizational levels.

# Key features of the system include:

-Secure login and session management using token-based authentication.

-A clean and intuitive interface for adding and viewing driver and cab information.

-A vendor-specific dashboard with real-time statistics and insights into fleet performance.

-Permission-based access control to safeguard data and maintain structured workflows.

-Automatic tracking of document expiry for drivers and cabs, with flagging mechanisms.

-Filtering and search functionalities for efficient data management.
