# Vendor-Fleet-System
This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of a fleet of cabs and drivers within a hierarchical vendor structure. It aims to digitize and simplify the onboarding and monitoring processes involved in fleet operations, especially in organizations where multiple vendors and subvendors are involved.

# Key features of the system include:

-Secure login and session management using token-based authentication.

-A clean and intuitive interface for adding and viewing driver and cab information.

-A vendor-specific dashboard with real-time statistics and insights into fleet performance.

-Permission-based access control to safeguard data and maintain structured workflows.

-Automatic tracking of document expiry for drivers and cabs, with flagging mechanisms.

-Filtering and search functionalities for efficient data management.
